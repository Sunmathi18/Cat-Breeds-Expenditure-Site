    <p>
        Persian cats are calm and gentle creatures who don’t do well with loud noises and constant disruption. They are incredibly affectionate toward their pet parents, but their calm and reserved nature make them ideal for quieter homes without young kids.Persians are super lazy, making them perfect lapcats. They’re often nicknamed “furniture with fur” because they can spend hours in the same spot without flinching. Persians are fun to be around and love interaction and playtime but won’t claw on your furniture and don’t have the curiosity to wreak havoc on your home.

        Siamese cats are often considered the most vocal of the domestic feline breeds. Those in the know chock this chattiness up to their intelligent and social nature. Not only do they crave human affection, but they aren’t afraid to ask for it either! Many people compare the attention-seeking yowls of a Siamese kitty to the cry of a baby.

Luckily, their intelligent and playful nature means that they are also among the most trainable breeds. Maybe you can teach yours to “speak” only on command.As mentioned above, Siamese cats are among the most social breeds, which also means they are exceptionally friendly. Those looking for a cuddly companion that can coexist comfortably with the entire family can’t do much better than a Siamese! Most cat sites even recommend them for families with dogs and small children.

        One of the most notable features of a Bengal cat is its coat. Whether you love the pattern or its softness, a Bengal's coat is hard to beat. 

The Bengal cat is the only domestic breed with markings like a leopard or jaguar. This unique pattern can be spotted with large rosettes or marbled.

Along with a striking pattern, the Bengal's coat is surprisingly soft. It's dense like a wildcat's coat with the softness of a domestic cat.There are some long-haired varieties of Bengal cats. They're sometimes called cashmere Bengals, but they aren't recognized as a breed worldwide.

    <p>
        The Ragdoll is a large, impressive and luxuriantly coated cat breed. Underneath an impressive silky, dense, and semi-long to long haired coat, there is a long, muscular cat with a broad chest, short neck, and sturdy legs. The tail is long and bushy, and the coat will, in the adult cat, form fluffy trousers on the hind-legs and a majestic ruff around the neck and throat.   The Ragdoll is described as ‘astonishingly equable’ and this is a thoroughly agreeable, relaxed, affectionate cat to share a home with. Rarely do owners have just one Ragdoll however, their beautiful appearance and gentle, languid nature is irresistible!

        The British Shorthair is a medium to large sized, compact, chunky cat, known for their attractive features and thick, plush fur.  

Short coupled and robust, the British Shorthair is instantly recognisable by their rounded face and large round eyes, giving this cat an adorable expression and bags of character.  Affectionate, playful, and loyal, the British Shorthair is a very companionable cat with family and close friends, although like many cats they may take a little time to warm up to strangers. A relatively quiet cat, and surprisingly gregarious, the British Shorthair gets on well in multi-cat households and will befriend other household pets too, particularly cat-friendly dogs.
